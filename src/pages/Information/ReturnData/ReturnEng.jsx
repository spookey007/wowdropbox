        website (the <strong>Site</strong>). The Policy is developed in
        accordance with the consumer protection laws of the Republic of Estonia
        and the regulatory acts of the European Union. The Seller (

      <p>
        This Return Policy applies to all sales contracts for goods concluded
        via the Site and is an integral part of such contracts.
      </p>

      <h2>Right of Withdrawal and Return Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        The Buyer has the right to withdraw from the received goods without
        giving any reason within <strong>14 calendar days</strong> from the date
        of delivery of the goods (surprise box). This period is established in
        accordance with European Union consumer protection legislation. To
        exercise the right of withdrawal, the Buyer must, within the specified
        period, complete a return request form (see Section 5) and send it to
        the Seller. The Seller will acknowledge receipt of the request and
        provide the Buyer with instructions on returning the goods.
      </p>
      <p>Returned goods must be in their original condition, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>intact product appearance,</li>
        <li>complete set of items,</li>
        <li>all original consumer properties,</li>
        <li>all labels and original packaging.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goods must not have been used or damaged after receipt. If the Buyer
        violates these conditions (for example, if the box has been opened and
        the product has been damaged through use), the Seller may refuse the
        return or withhold part of the refund amount not exceeding the reduction
        in the product’s value.
      </p>

      <h2>Exceptions to the Right of Return</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Opened surprise boxes:</strong> The right of return does not
          apply to surprise boxes whose packaging has been opened by the Buyer.
          According to applicable law, if the packaging of a consumer product
          (for example, a surprise box sealed with a special lock or seal) has
          been opened, such product cannot be returned (except in cases of a
          discovered manufacturing defect). If, after opening the box, it is
          found that the product has a manufacturing defect, the rules for
          returning defective goods apply (see Section 4).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Digital content:</strong> No refunds are permitted for digital
          prizes (in-game items, access codes, digital files, certificates,
          etc.) once they have been delivered or activated if the Buyer has
          consented to immediate receipt of such content and confirmed awareness
          of losing the right of withdrawal. This corresponds to the EU
          legislation’s exception regarding the return of digital goods.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cases of Refunds</h2>
      <p>Refunds are made in the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Defective or damaged goods:</strong> If after receiving the
          surprise box the items inside are found to be damaged, not working, or
          not as described, the Buyer may demand a refund of the amount paid or
          a replacement of the goods. The Buyer must provide evidence of the
          defect (for example, photographs of the damage) and complete the
          return form.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-delivery of goods:</strong> If, due to the fault of the
          Seller or the carrier, the ordered goods were not delivered to the
          Buyer within the agreed timeframe, the Buyer is entitled to a full
          refund of the amount paid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical issues:</strong> If, for technical reasons, the
          Buyer did not receive the promised digital prize (for example, the
          sent code is not working, its validity has expired, or a system error
          occurred), the Buyer may demand a refund.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the cases listed above, refunds are made in full, corresponding to
        the actual amount paid for the goods. Refunds are processed using the
        same payment method that the Buyer used, unless otherwise agreed by the
        parties. The Seller will complete the refund no later than{" "}
        <strong>14 calendar days</strong> after receiving the notice of return
        or confirmation of non-delivery of the digital content.
      </p>

      <h2>Return Procedure</h2>
      <p>
        For return processing, the Buyer fills out a return request form. The
        form includes the following fields and information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buyer's surname, name, and patronymic;</li>
        <li>Buyer's contact email address;</li>
        <li>Order number and date (as indicated on the Site);</li>
        <li>Name or brief description of the product/surprise box;</li>
        <li>
          Reason for return with a detailed description of the problem or
          circumstances (for example, “product damaged,” “product not received,”
          “invalid digital code,” etc.);
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, additional information and files (for example, photographs
          of any damage).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The completed form is sent by the Buyer to the Seller via the special
        feedback form on the Site or to the email address{" "}
        <a href="mailto:info@wowdropbox.eu">info@wowdropbox.eu</a>. After
        receiving the return form, the Seller will notify the Buyer of the
        decision within <strong>10 working days</strong> and provide
        instructions on further actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the return is approved, the Buyer sends the returned goods (the
        physical surprise box with contents) to the address specified by the
        Seller. The shipping costs for returning the goods are paid by the
        Buyer, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. After receiving and
        inspecting the goods, the Seller initiates the refund in the prescribed
        manner. The refund is generally completed within{" "}
        <strong>14 days</strong> after the Seller receives the returned goods or
        confirmation of non-receipt of the digital content.
      </p>
