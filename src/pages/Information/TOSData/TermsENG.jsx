        <strong>Subject of Services.</strong> The Company provides the User with
        an online service for purchasing virtual Dropboxes containing randomly
        determined goods or prizes (“Goods”). The services also include
        processing orders, revealing (opening) the Dropbox, informing the User
        about the items won, and if necessary – delivering any won physical
        goods to the User. Each Dropbox is guaranteed to contain item(s) with a
        real market value not lower than the purchase price of that box, i.e.
        the User in any case receives equal or greater material value in return.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal and Permitted Use.</strong> Access to the Site is
        provided to you for personal use only. It is prohibited to use the Site
        for commercial purposes (for example, reselling items to third parties
        without the Company’s consent) or in any way not provided for in these
        Terms. All rights not expressly granted to you with respect to the Site
        and its content are reserved by the Company.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Privacy Policy.</strong> By accepting these Terms, you also
        agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy, which governs the processing
        of Users’ personal data. The Privacy Policy is available via a link on
        the Site. Please review it to understand how the Company collects and
        uses your personal data.
      </p>

      {/* --- */}
      <h2>Account Registration</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Account.</strong> To access the full functionality of the Site,
        including purchasing Dropboxes, a User may register a personal account.
        Registration requires providing a valid email address, creating a secure
        password, and submitting other requested information (such as name,
        country of residence, etc.). Each User is entitled to register only{" "}
        <strong>one account</strong> on the Site. It is forbidden for one person
        to create or use more than one account, as well as to transfer or sell
        your account to other persons. If multiple accounts belonging to one
        User are discovered, the Company has the right to block or delete all
        duplicate accounts and to void any results (winnings) obtained in
        violation of this rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Confidentiality of Access.</strong> You are responsible for
        maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials, including
        your password. Do not disclose your password to third parties. All
        actions performed using your login and password will be deemed to have
        been performed by you. If you discover or suspect any unauthorized
        access to your account or loss of your password, you must immediately
        notify the Company (for example, via customer support). Until such
        notice is received, the Company is entitled to assume that it is you
        personally accessing the account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Accuracy.</strong> You agree to keep your account
        information up to date. In particular, your delivery address must be
        valid and complete so that we can send you physical goods. The Company
        is not liable for consequences arising from the User providing
        incorrect, outdated, or misleading information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Verification and Age.</strong> The Company may at any time
        request proof of your identity and age (for example, a copy of an
        identity document), especially if there are suspicions of a violation of
        the Terms or law (for example, suspicion that the User is under 18, or
        suspicion of fraudulent actions). For the purposes of complying with
        legal requirements (including anti-fraud and anti-money laundering
        measures) you agree to provide the requested data and documents in a
        timely and truthful manner. Failure to provide necessary information may
        result in suspension of service or account blocking until the situation
        is clarified.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Suspension and Deletion of Account (by Company).</strong> The
        Company reserves the right, upon detecting the User’s violation of these
        Terms or legal requirements, to temporarily or permanently block such
        User’s account. In this case, the Company will notify the User of the
        measure taken and, where possible, of the reasons. If the blocking
        occurred due to the User’s fault (for example, for prohibited actions –
        see Section 7 below), the Company is entitled to void any pending
        transactions of the User and cancel any prizes/items not yet shipped,
        without compensating the cost of Dropboxes purchased in violation. The
        User is not entitled to claim reimbursement of any losses related to a
        lawful account block for breach of the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Account Deletion by User.</strong> You have the right to stop
        using the Site and request deletion of your account by contacting
        customer support. The Company will carry out deletion (or anonymization)
        of your personal data and account within the timeframes provided by the
        Privacy Policy, provided there are no outstanding obligations or
        unfinished transactions. Please note that before requesting account
        deletion you should ensure you have received all prizes/items that were
        won and not yet shipped, or formally decline them in writing. Deletion
        of an account means you will no longer have access to any unshipped
        items remaining in the account, and the Company will not be obliged to
        store or send them after the account is deleted.
      </p>

      {/* --- */}
      <h2>Payment and Dropbox Purchase Process</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Placing an Order.</strong> Prices for available Dropboxes are
        indicated on the Site in euros (EUR) or another currency explicitly
        shown when selecting a product. To purchase a Dropbox, the User selects
        the desired box and follows the instructions for payment. The purchase
        contract for a Dropbox between the User and the Company is considered
        concluded at the moment the User’s payment is confirmed as successful.
        Upon receipt of payment, the Company provides the ability to immediately
        open the purchased Dropbox (virtually reveal its contents). One Dropbox
        purchase entitles the User to receive one prize (item) or set of items,
        determined randomly at the moment of opening.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Payment Methods.</strong> Payment on the Site is made using the
        available methods listed during checkout (for example, Visa/MasterCard
        bank cards, bank transfer, electronic payment systems, etc.).
        Cryptocurrencies or internal virtual money are not accepted as a means
        of payment unless explicitly indicated on the Site. When choosing a
        payment method, you may be presented with terms and fees of third-party
        payment providers (banks, processing companies). The Company may engage
        a third-party payment processor to handle transactions; in such case,
        responsibility for security and timely execution of the payment lies in
        part with that processor. We recommend that you familiarize yourself
        with the service terms of your chosen payment method.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Payment Authorization.</strong> By submitting payment
        information, you confirm that you have the legal right to use the
        selected payment method (for example, you are the lawful holder of the
        bank card). Payment authentication may be required (for example,
        entering a 3-D Secure code). If a bank or payment system refuses to
        authorize the transaction, the Dropbox purchase will not be completed.
        The Company is not liable for delays or inability to process payment due
        to the operation of payment systems. If a payment was made in error (for
        example, an incorrect amount was charged) or you discover an
        unauthorized charge, contact our support service for resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Taxes and Fees.</strong> Prices listed on the Site include
        applicable value-added tax (VAT) or other similar taxes, if explicitly
        stated. However, the price does not include possible additional fees not
        directly related to the item’s price, such as customs duties, import
        taxes in your country, your bank’s processing fees, etc. The User is
        solely responsible for paying all taxes and fees associated with making
        a purchase and receiving an item, except for those which by law the
        Company is obliged to pay. For example, if you are outside the EU and
        import duties are incurred when the item is delivered to your country,
        you are required to pay them directly to the carrier or customs
        authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opening Moment and Deduction of Funds.</strong> Immediately
        after successful payment is confirmed, the cost of the purchased Dropbox
        is charged (funds are received by the Company), and the process of
        opening the box on the Site is initiated for the User. The result (the
        prize/item won) is determined randomly by a generator built into the
        Site’s system. The prize allocation algorithm is random and fair (the
        Provably Fair principle): each of the items provided for a given box is
        awarded in proportion to preset probabilities, with no bias. The Company
        guarantees that the market value of the prize obtained will not be lower
        than the price of the Dropbox paid by the User. If a technical failure
        occurred during the box opening or incorrect information about the won
        item was displayed (for example, due to an interface error the screen
        showed the wrong item), then the actual result is deemed to be the item
        that was determined by our random allocation algorithm on the server. We
        will inform the User of the correct result in their account or via
        email. The User has no right to claim an item that was mistakenly
        displayed due to a glitch if that item was not in fact won.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Order Cancellation and Refusal to Process.</strong> The Company
        reverses the right to refuse to carry out a transaction or cancel a
        Dropbox purchase before it is opened in the following cases: (a) the
        Company has grounds to believe that the payment was made fraudulently or
        unlawfully (for example, using a stolen card); (b) the User is violating
        these Terms or has attempted to circumvent the Site’s technical
        restrictions; (c) an obvious technical error occurred on the Site
        affecting the correctness of the price or purchase process. In the event
        a paid purchase is canceled before the Dropbox is opened, the User will
        be refunded the amount paid via the same method it was received (unless
        a different method is required to comply with the law). The Company may
        request additional information or verification from you (for example,
        proof of identity or card ownership) before processing a refund, in
        order to ensure the legitimacy of the request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Confirmation and Documents.</strong> The Company may issue
        electronic documents confirming the purchase (such as an invoice or a
        cash receipt in electronic form that meet the requirements of Estonian
        law). You can request to receive such documents by contacting support.
        All financial transactions are carried out in accordance with applicable
        law. If suspicious payments are detected, the Company has the right to
        suspend service provision and conduct an investigation, and in case of
        fraud – to cancel the corresponding orders and hold the offenders
        accountable, including forwarding information to law enforcement
        authorities.
      </p>

      {/* --- */}
      <h2>Delivery of Won Goods</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Receiving a Prize (Item).</strong> After a Dropbox is opened and
        the prize is determined, information about the prize is displayed in the
        User’s account (in the “inventory” section or similar). If the prize is
        a physical item, the User has the right to request its delivery. To do
        this, the User must initiate the “redemption” or shipping procedure for
        the prize through the Site’s interface, providing a current postal
        delivery address and confirming payment of the shipping cost (if it is
        not free). Prizes of a virtual nature (for example, digital codes,
        coupons, etc., if offered) may be provided directly in electronic form
        without physical delivery – such prizes are considered received
        immediately after opening the box, and Sections 4.2–4.6 apply to them
        only to the extent related to their provision (not to shipping).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Delivery Cost.</strong> The cost of shipping each physical item
        is calculated and displayed to the User before confirming dispatch. The
        cost depends on the dimensions/weight of the item, the destination
        country, and the chosen delivery method (if there are options). In some
        cases, the Company may offer free shipping (for example, for orders
        above a certain amount or as part of a promotion) – such conditions will
        be indicated separately on the Site. If free shipping is not provided,
        the User must pay the specified delivery costs before the item will be
        dispatched. Payment for delivery is made via available methods similarly
        to payment for Dropboxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dispatch and Delivery Times.</strong> The Company strives to
        dispatch prizes as quickly as possible. Usually, an item is shipped
        within <strong>2–5 working days</strong> from the moment we receive all
        information necessary for delivery from the User and payment for
        delivery (if applicable). Estimated delivery times depend on the chosen
        method and the recipient’s address: within the European Union delivery
        usually takes <strong>5 to 15 working days</strong>. Delivery outside
        the EU may take longer (for example, 10–30 days) considering customs
        processing. Please note that the mentioned timeframes are approximate.
        The actual delivery time may vary due to factors beyond the Company’s
        control – workload of postal/courier services, holiday periods, force
        majeure circumstances, etc. The Company is not liable for delays caused
        by forces outside our control, however we commit to informing the User
        of significant delays and making efforts to resolve any issues that
        arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Import Duties and Restrictions.</strong> If delivery is to a
        country outside the European Union, the parcel may be subject to import
        duties, taxes and/or other fees in the destination country. Such charges
        are not included in the Dropbox price or the shipping cost calculated by
        the Company, and are the responsibility of the Recipient (User). Customs
        regulations of different countries may restrict the import of certain
        categories of goods. The User should familiarize themselves with their
        country’s laws regarding receiving winnings/shipments from abroad. The
        Company is not responsible for the inability to import an item into the
        User’s country if that item is prohibited or restricted for shipment in
        that jurisdiction. If necessary, the User may inquire with the Company,
        before redeeming a prize, from which location the item will be shipped,
        in order to assess potential customs expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Risk and Title.</strong> Title to a physical item passes to the
        User at the moment the item is handed over to the carrier for delivery
        to the address specified by the User. However, the risk of accidental
        loss or damage to the item passes to the User only from the moment the
        User (or their authorized representative) actually receives the item at
        the delivery address. This means that the Company bears the risk of loss
        or damage to the item during transportation until it is handed over to
        the User. If the User independently selects a carrier and delivery
        method not offered by the Company, and instructs the Company to hand the
        item over to that carrier, the risk passes to the User at the moment the
        item is handed to the carrier they selected.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tracking and Receipt.</strong> After dispatching an item, the
        Company will generally provide the User with a tracking number or other
        tracking information (if this is available with the chosen delivery
        service). The User is responsible for ensuring timely receipt/collection
        of the shipped item. If delivery is by courier, please ensure someone
        can receive the parcel at the delivery address. In case of postal
        delivery, if you were not present, a notice may be left regarding a
        re-delivery attempt or the need to collect the parcel from a post
        office/pick-up point. If the User does not take the necessary actions to
        receive the parcel (for example, is repeatedly absent at the delivery
        address or does not collect the parcel from the post office within the
        allotted time), and the parcel is returned to the sender, the Company
        will contact the User to arrange a re-shipment. Re-shipment may require
        the User to pay the delivery cost again (if the initial delivery was
        paid), or, at the Company’s discretion, the cost of re-delivery may be
        deducted from the amount to be refunded to the User. If the Company
        cannot reach the User via the provided contacts within a reasonable time
        or the User refuses re-delivery, the Company has the right to cancel the
        shipment. In such case, the purchase contract for the respective prize
        (item) is considered terminated at the User’s initiative, and the
        Company will refund the User the amount paid for the box minus the
        expenses of the initial delivery (if they were not paid separately) and
        any other costs incurred by the Company related to the failed delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Item Unavailable (Prize Replacement).</strong> In rare cases, a
        situation may arise where the announced prize (item) that the User won
        cannot be shipped. This could happen, for example, if the item turned
        out to be temporarily out of stock or discontinued, or a manufacturing
        defect was found in all available units, or a ban on its sale was
        imposed. In such a situation, the Company will notify the User as soon
        as possible and offer one of the following options at the User’s choice:
        (a) waiting for the item to become available and delaying delivery; (b)
        replacing the won item with another similar item of equal or greater
        value (for example, a different color or model, or an equivalent item
        with similar characteristics in the same price category); (c) canceling
        the win with a refund of the full price of the corresponding Dropbox
        paid by the User. The User may independently choose a suitable option
        from those offered. If the User does not communicate their choice within
        a reasonable time (for example, within 5 working days), the Company may,
        at its discretion, either send a replacement item as close as possible
        in specifications and value to the won item, or issue a refund for that
        item (Dropbox) to the User’s account. Providing a replacement item or a
        refund constitutes full performance of the Company’s obligations for
        that prize; the originally won (but unavailable) item in this case will
        not be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Loss or Damage in Delivery.</strong> The Company carefully
        packages items for shipment, but unforeseen circumstances can occur in
        transit. If the prize (item) was not delivered to the User due to loss
        of the shipment by the carrier or other delivery failure, the User
        should notify the Company as soon as possible (for example, by email at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:info@wowdropbox.eu">info@wowdropbox.eu</a>), including
        the order information and, if possible, confirmation/evidence of
        non-delivery (for example, an official tracking status “lost” or a
        postal statement of loss). The Company will conduct an investigation
        with the carrier’s involvement. Upon confirmation of the loss of the
        shipment, the Company will offer the User a choice: re-shipment of the
        same item (if it is available) at our expense, or a full refund of the
        amount paid for the corresponding Dropbox and delivery. If the User
        cannot provide the requested information to substantiate the
        non-delivery (for example, if required – a written declaration of not
        having received the item), and the Company cannot verify the loss, a
        refund or re-shipment may not be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>If the Item Arrived Defective or Damaged.</strong> We strive to
        ensure high quality and authenticity of all prizes shipped. If you
        received an item and it turned out to be defective, damaged in transit,
        or not as described, please contact our support within a reasonable time
        (it is recommended within <strong>48 hours of receipt</strong>) and
        describe the problem. It is advisable to attach photographs of the
        received item showing the defect or damage, as well as of the packaging
        (if it is damaged). After receiving the complaint, the Company will
        arrange a solution: depending on the nature of the issue, the User may
        be offered to return the item and receive a replacement or a refund. If
        a defect or damage is confirmed, the Company will pay the costs of
        shipping the item back to us. The User must pack the item carefully for
        the return. After receiving the returned defective item, the Company
        will send a replacement (the same model and configuration, without
        defects) at its own expense or refund the User the full price of the
        Dropbox and the initial delivery cost. The choice between replacement
        and refund is determined in consultation with the User, taking into
        account the availability of a similar item. If upon inspection of the
        returned item the Company finds that the claimed defect is absent or the
        item arrived in good condition, the replacement or refund may be
        refused; in that case the item will be sent back to the User, and the
        User will need to pay the costs of re-shipping it to them.

      <p>
        <strong>Authenticity and Warranty of Goods.</strong> The Company
        guarantees that all physical goods offered as prizes are original and
        authentic, acquired from reliable suppliers. We thoroughly inspect the
        products before shipping to ensure their quality and conformity with the
        description. All legally provided warranties and consumer rights apply
        to the items. In particular, goods must correspond to their description
        and have no hidden defects. If a manufacturing defect of an item is
        subsequently discovered (not related to normal wear and tear or improper
        use) within the legally established warranty period (for example, within{" "}
        <strong>2 years</strong> from the day of receipt for durable goods in EU
        countries), the User has the right to contact the Company with a claim.
        We will review such a claim and, if justified, ensure the measures
        provided by law – repair, replacement or refund of the amount paid –
        within the established timeframes. Nothing in these Terms limits your
        inalienable consumer rights provided by law (including warranty rights
        for product quality).

        <h2>Right to Withdraw from Purchase and Return of Goods</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Right of Withdrawal (Return of Goods) for Consumers.</strong>{" "}
          If you purchase goods as a consumer residing in the territory of the
          European Union, you have the right to withdraw from the sales contract
          of a good concluded remotely (online) without giving any reason within{" "}
          <strong>14 calendar days</strong> from the moment of receiving the
          good. In the context of the Site, this means that you can choose to
          return a physical prize (item) obtained as a result of opening a
          Dropbox and get back the amount you paid for it. The right of
          withdrawal is governed by EU Directive 2011/83/EC on consumer rights
          and the corresponding national legislation, and applies subject to the
          exceptions noted below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Procedure for Exercising the Right of Withdrawal.</strong> To
          exercise your right of withdrawal, you must, within the 14-day period
          from the date you received the item, send the Company a clear
          statement of your intention to return the item. You can do this by
          emailing <a href="mailto:info@wowdropbox.eu">info@wowdropbox.eu</a> or
          using another contact form indicated on the Site, with a message about
          your decision to withdraw from the purchase. In your message, include
          your details (name, email address used for the order), the name or
          description of the item you are withdrawing from, and the date of
          receipt of the item. We will confirm receipt of your withdrawal
          notification.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Conditions for Return of the Item.</strong> In the event of
          withdrawal from the purchase, you must send the item back to the
          Company no later than <strong>14 days</strong> from the date of
          sending the withdrawal statement. It is sufficient if you hand the
          item over to a delivery service before this 14-day period expires. The
          item should be returned in its original condition, if possible in the
          original packaging, with undamaged labels and the full set of contents
          (accessories, documentation, etc.) if they were included. The User
          pays the direct costs of return shipping, unless the Company has
          agreed to cover these costs in advance. We recommend using a reliable
          shipping method with tracking to avoid loss of the returned item.
          Until the item is received back from the User, the User bears the risk
          of accidental deterioration or loss of the item.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Condition of the Returned Item.</strong> You are entitled to
          unpack the received item and check its functionality and
          characteristics to the extent that would be permissible in a typical
          store before purchase. However, if the item was used beyond the
          minimum necessary for inspection and as a result it has lost its
          saleable condition, the Company reserves the right to reduce the
          refund amount proportionally to the reduction in the item’s value. For
          example, if the returned item shows signs of use, scratches, damage or
          incomplete set, the refund amount may be reduced. In especially severe
          cases of damage, a refund may not be issued (if the item cannot be
          restored and has completely lost its value).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Refund of Funds upon Withdrawal.</strong> After receiving the
          returned item (or receiving proof from you of having sent the item
          back, whichever occurs first) the Company will issue a refund of the
          paid funds. The refund will be made no later than{" "}
          <strong>14 calendar days</strong> from the date we receive your
          withdrawal notice; however, we have the right to withhold
          reimbursement until we receive the returned item or you provide
          evidence of having sent it back – depending on which occurs first. The
          amount to be refunded includes the price of the item paid when
          purchasing the Dropbox as well as the original cost of delivering the
          item to you (if it was a separate line item), with the exception of
          additional costs incurred because you chose a non-standard (more
          expensive) delivery method when redeeming the prize. The refund will
          be made using the same method of payment that you used, unless
          explicitly agreed otherwise. The User does not incur any penalty for
          exercising the right of withdrawal within the prescribed period.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exceptions to the Right of Withdrawal.</strong> Please note
          that legislation provides certain exceptions where the 14-day
          withdrawal from contract does not apply. In the context of our Site,
          the following items cannot be canceled or returned:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Services fully performed within the 14-day period.</strong>{" "}
            Specifically, the purchase and opening of a Dropbox is treated as a
            service/digital product performed immediately at your request. By
            confirming the purchase of a Dropbox and its immediate opening, you
            consent to the immediate execution of the service and understand
            that you lose the right to withdraw from that Dropbox purchase after
            opening, since the service of providing a random prize has been
            rendered in full.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital content not supplied on a tangible medium.</strong>{" "}
            If the prize is a digital code or file, and it was delivered to you
            (displayed in your account or sent to your e-mail) with your consent
            before the withdrawal period expired, then such a prize cannot be
            returned.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Goods made to order or clearly personalized for you.
            </strong>{" "}
            This includes any item custom-made to your specifications or
            personalized.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Perishable goods or goods that quickly deteriorate.</strong>{" "}
            Items that by their nature are liable to deteriorate or expire
            rapidly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Sealed goods not suitable for return for health or hygiene
              reasons, if unsealed.
            </strong>{" "}
            If their packaging was opened after delivery. (This applies only to
            relevant categories, e.g. cosmetics, food products, etc., which
            typically would not be offered in Dropboxes without warning.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Refund of Funds in Other Cases.</strong> Outside the exercise
          of the 14-day right of withdrawal, a refund of amounts paid by the
          User is only possible in cases expressly provided by these Terms or
          applicable law. In particular, a refund or re-shipment is provided in
          the event of confirmed loss of a shipment (see cl. 4.8), in case of a
          defective/damaged item (cl. 4.9), or if an item is unavailable (cl.
          4.7). As a general rule, the purchase of a Dropbox and the resulting
          prize are final and not subject to return on the grounds, for example,
          that the User is dissatisfied with the item received. Until the point
          of payment and opening of a Dropbox, you are free to cancel placing an
          order, but after the box is opened no refund is given except in the
          situations outlined above. Therefore, please take into account the
          element of chance when using our service: less desirable prizes are
          balanced by the chance to obtain a more valuable reward, and this
          uncertainty is part of the service accepted by the User.

          are protected by copyright, trademark law, know-how and other legal
          provisions. The trademarks, trade names and logos of the Company
          (including the name “wowdropbox” and other brands under which it
          operates) are protected by law. The User does not acquire any
          ownership rights to elements of the Site as a result of using it. It
          is prohibited to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, publish, copy or

          identifying the prizes on offer and does not imply any affiliation,
          approval or endorsement by the respective rights holders. For example,
          if a prize is a smartphone of a certain brand, the corresponding

          thereby grants the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use,
          reproduce, display and distribute that content as needed for the

          right is granted for the period the content is posted on the Site and

            Fraudulent payment activities (including baseless chargebacks) may

          enforcement authorities and regulators in the event of detection of
          unlawful actions by Users and, upon appropriate official requests, may
          provide information about violators as required by law.

          <strong>Fulfillment of Obligations.</strong> The Company undertakes to
          provide the services in accordance with these Terms, to perform its
          obligations assumed in good faith (for example, to ship paid goods on
          time), and to comply with legal requirements on consumer rights

          Terms, to pay properly for the Dropboxes and delivery, to provide
          accurate information for order fulfillment, and to refrain from
          actions that could cause damage to the Company or third parties.

          <strong>Disclaimer of Additional Warranties by the Company.</strong>{" "}
          The Company uses reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of
          information on the Site, error-free and uninterrupted operation of the
          service, that the goods meet users’ expectations, etc. Nevertheless,
          the Site and services are provided “as is” and “as available.” The
          Company does not give any additional warranty not expressly stated in
          these Terms. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company does
          not guarantee that: (a) the services will meet all of the User’s
          expectations and requirements; (b) the Site will function
          uninterrupted, error-free, and securely at any given time; (c) the
          prizes obtained by the User will exactly satisfy their subjective
          expectations regarding value, quality or other parameters (apart from
          the guarantees of item description conformity and minimum value
          provided in these Terms); (d) any errors or defects on the Site will
          be corrected immediately. The Company disclaims all implied warranties
          of merchantability, fitness of the services for a particular purpose,
          and warranties arising from trade usage or practice, to the extent
          allowed by applicable law. This clause does not affect legal
          warranties and rights which by law cannot be excluded or limited (for

          <strong>Limitation of the Company’s Liability.</strong> To the fullest

          from or in connection with the use of the Site is limited to the
          User’s actual direct losses incurred. The amount of the Company’s
          total aggregate liability for any claims or causes will not exceed a
          sum equal to the total cost of Dropboxes purchased by the User in the
          last 6 months preceding the event giving rise to the liability (or, if
          the claim is related to a specific purchase or item – liability is
          limited to the amount paid for the corresponding Dropbox). The Company
          is not liable for any indirect or consequential losses or damages
          incurred by the User in the use of the Site, including but not limited
          to: lost profits, loss of expected savings, loss of data, moral
          damage, loss of business reputation or any other intangible harm, even
          if the Company was advised of the possibility of such damage. The
          Company also is not liable for failure to provide services or untimely
          performance of obligations due to reasons beyond its reasonable
          control (force majeure, see cl. 8.6).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>User’s Responsibility.</strong> The User understands that
          non-compliance with the Terms or legal requirements may result in
          civil, administrative or criminal liability for them. The User is
          liable for any losses caused to the Company by violating these Terms,
          in accordance with general principles of liability (for example, they
          are obliged to compensate the Company for direct losses, fines,
          litigation costs arising from the User’s unlawful actions). In
          addition, the User is responsible for the accuracy of information
          provided by them and shall compensate losses incurred by the Company
          as a result of providing incorrect or false data (for example, costs
          of re-delivery due to an incorrect address, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Indemnification.</strong> The User agrees to hold the Company,
          as well as its subsidiaries and affiliates, officers, employees,
          agents, and partners, harmless and indemnify them for any direct
          losses, damage, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees)
          that they incur as a result of: (a) the User’s violation of these
          Terms; (b) illegal actions or omissions of the User in using the Site;
          or (c) claims by third parties related to materials the User posted on
          the Site, or to the User’s actions on the Site. The Company reserves
          the right to independently defend against any such claims, without
          relieving the User of the obligation to compensate the losses
          incurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Force Majeure.</strong> The Company is not liable for full or
          partial failure to fulfill its obligations if it was a direct result
          of force majeure circumstances. Such circumstances include, in
          particular: natural disasters; fire, explosion; military actions,
          civil unrest, terrorist acts; decisions of government authorities that
          prevent fulfillment of obligations; strikes in transport or logistics
          companies; failures in power grids, internet or telecommunications;
          hacker attacks on the Site’s infrastructure; or other similar
          circumstances beyond the Company’s reasonable control. In the event of
          a force majeure occurrence, the timeframe for the Company’s
          performance of obligations is automatically extended for the duration
          of the hindrance. The Company will, if possible, notify the User of
          the occurrence of force majeure and its expected duration. If the
          force majeure continues for more than 30 consecutive days and
          significantly hinders performance of obligations, each party has the
          right to terminate the agreement by notifying the other party. If the
          agreement is terminated due to force majeure, the User will be
          refunded the funds they paid for services not received (for example,
          for a paid but unshipped item), minus expenses already incurred by the
          Company by the time of termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Special Caveats.</strong> Nothing in these Terms excludes or
          limits the Company’s liability: (a) for causing death or personal
          injury due to the Company’s fault; (b) for gross negligence or willful
          actions causing harm to the User; (c) for fraud or intentional deceit
          by the Company; and (d) any other cases in which by law liability
          cannot be limited or excluded by agreement. Likewise, no provisions of
          the Terms shall be interpreted as limiting the statutory consumer
          rights – all such rights are preserved in full and are supplemented by
          the provisions of this agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms and the relationships
          arising from them between the User and the Company are governed by the
          law of the Republic of Estonia. If the User purchases services as a
          consumer residing in the European Union, such obligations may be
          subject to mandatory provisions of the consumer’s country of residence
          (for example, consumer protection laws) which take precedence over the
          chosen law. Nothing in these Terms reduces the level of consumer
          rights protection guaranteed by such mandatory provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Negotiations and Claims Procedure.</strong> In the event of
          any dispute, claim or disagreement related to these Terms or the use
          of the Site, the User must first contact the Company’s support service
          (at <a href="mailto:info@wowdropbox.eu">info@wowdropbox.eu</a> or
          through the Site interface) with a description of the issue and their
          claims. The Company will strive to respond and resolve the claim
          within a reasonable time (usually a response is provided within{" "}
          <strong>5–14 working days</strong>). The parties will make good faith
          efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Judicial Dispute Resolution.</strong> If a dispute cannot be
          resolved amicably, it is subject to consideration by judicial
          authorities according to the applicable law. In the absence of an
          alternative agreement between the parties, any dispute between the
          Company and the User arising from these Terms shall be brought before
          a competent court in Estonia. If the User is a consumer residing in
          the EU, they have the right, in addition to the court in Estonia, to
          file a claim against the Company in the court of their place of
          residence, as provided by Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 (Brussels I)
          or other applicable rules of private international law. In the event
          of a dispute with a consumer, the Company agrees to participate in
          proceedings in whichever jurisdiction the consumer chooses according
          to law.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Online Dispute Resolution Platform.</strong> In accordance
          with EU law, the Company informs Users about the possibility of using
          the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform established by the
          European Commission. The platform is available at:{" "}
          <a
            href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr
          </a>
          . Through this platform, a consumer can submit a complaint and attempt
          to resolve a dispute with a seller online. Please note that using this
          platform is a right, not an obligation of the consumer. The Company,
          for its part, is open to participating in alternative dispute
          resolution procedures; however, the specific decision on whether to
          engage in ADR will be made in each case separately. By this notice,
          the Company informs that it is not obligated by law to participate in
          alternative dispute resolution procedures, except in cases where such
          participation is mandatory under regulatory acts.
        </p>

        {/* --- */}
        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Changes to Terms.</strong> The Company may from time to time
          make changes to these Terms unilaterally, especially in the event of
          changes to the Site’s functionality, to comply with new legal
          requirements, or with changes in business practice. In the event of
          changes, the new version of the Terms is posted on the Site and marked
          with the date of last update (see the top of this document). We may
          also notify registered Users of significant changes via electronic
          message (e-mail) and/or through a notice on the Site itself. It is the
          User’s responsibility to periodically review these Terms for changes.
          If you do not agree with the new version of the Terms, you must stop
          using the Site and, if you have a registered account, you are entitled
          to request its deletion (provided all pending obligations are
          fulfilled). If after the effective date of the updated Terms the User
          continues to use the Site (for example, makes new purchases), this
          signifies agreement with the changes and acceptance of the new version
          in full.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Assignment of Rights and Obligations.</strong> The Company may
          transfer (assign) its rights and obligations under these Terms to a
          third party (for example, in the event of a business reorganization,
          or assignment of claims to a bank or other partner) provided that the
          User’s rights under the Terms are not affected. Such succession does
          not require the User’s consent, but the User will be duly notified if
          essential terms of service are affected. The User may not transfer
          their rights or obligations under these Terms to any third party
          without the prior written consent of the Company. This means, in
          particular, a prohibition on assigning the right to claim delivery of
          a prize to another person, transferring the account, or other rights
          under the agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is
          declared illegal, invalid or unenforceable through due process (for
          example, by a court or competent authority), that provision is deemed
          separable from the rest of the Terms and does not affect the validity
          and enforceability of the remaining parts of the agreement. In such
          case, the parties will replace the invalid provision with another
          legally correct provision that is as close as possible in meaning and
          intended effect to the original.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms (including the policies
          and documents referenced in them and incorporated by reference, such
          as the Privacy Policy) contain the full and exhaustive agreement
          between the User and the Company regarding the use of this Site and
          the wowdropbox service offered. All prior arrangements, negotiations,
          correspondence and agreements between the parties regarding this
          subject matter cease to be in force from the moment the User accepts
          these Terms. In case of a conflict between these Terms and any public
          information on the Site (for example, promotional materials, FAQs,
          etc.), these Terms shall prevail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No Waiver.</strong> The failure or delay of either Party in
          exercising any right or requirement under these Terms does not
          constitute a waiver of such right or requirement in the future. If the
          Company does not enforce any provision of the Terms in a particular
          instance, this does not mean a waiver of the ability to enforce it in
          the event of a repeat violation or in any other situation. Any waiver
          of any right or provision will be effective only if it is made in
          writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of the
          respective Party.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contact Details.</strong> If you have any questions regarding
          these Terms or need to send us any notice under the agreement, you can
          contact us by email at{" "}

          or on the next day after a notice is posted on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Languages and Translation.</strong> These Terms are provided
          to the User in the Russian language for convenience of reference. If
          the Company provides an official translation of the Terms into other
          languages, the Russian version will continue to have legal force for
          Russian-speaking users. In case of any discrepancies between the
          Russian-language version of the Terms and their translation, the
          version published in Russian shall take precedence (or another version
          that the Company specifically designates as official).
