      <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer,
        smartphone, or tablet) when you visit websites. They contain data about
        your actions and settings on the site. For example, cookies can remember
        which products you have added to your shopping cart, the interface
        language you have selected, or other preferences. This information helps
        improve the site’s performance, make it faster, and provide a
        personalized experience for the user.
      </p>

      <h2>What Cookies We Use</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies to ensure the functionality of the Site and to enhance
        the user experience. The following categories of cookies are used on our
        Site:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical (essential) cookies:</strong> These cookies are
          necessary for the correct functioning of the website. They, for
          example, allow you to save items in your shopping cart during a
          purchase, provide user authentication, and maintain sessions. Without
          these cookies, some features of the Site may be unavailable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functional cookies:</strong> These cookies allow the website
          to remember the choices you make (such as the interface language) and
          provide additional conveniences. Thanks to these cookies, the Site
          remembers your preferences for a more comfortable browsing experience
          on subsequent visits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytical (performance) cookies:</strong> These cookies
          collect information about how visitors use the Site, but we do not use
          any such cookies because we do not use web analytics systems on our
          Site.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising (marketing) cookies:</strong> These cookies track
          your browsing patterns to show you personalized ads, but we do not use
          advertising cookies on our Site and do not display personalized
          advertising based on site visits.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Managing Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        You can change cookie settings in your browser or device at any time.
        For example, most browsers allow you to:
        <br />– block the saving of cookies,
        <br />– delete individual cookies, or
        <br />– notify you before cookies are saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailed instructions on how to manage your cookie settings can be found
        in your browser’s help section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> If you disable or delete the necessary cookies,
        some sections of the Site may be unavailable or function incorrectly
        (for example, you may need to add items to your cart again). If you
        disable functional cookies, the Site will stop remembering your personal
        settings, and some conveniences (for example, a saved interface
        language) may be unavailable.
      </p>
